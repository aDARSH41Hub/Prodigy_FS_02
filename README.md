A full-stack Employee Management System built with **React,Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB**,developed as part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Full Stack Web Development Internship** (Task 2). The application provides secure JWT authentication, role-based access control and complete CRUD functionality for employee management.

Access to every employee route is restricted to authenticated admin users only, built on top of the JWT authentication system from Task 1.

## ✨ Features

### 🗂️ Employee Management (CRUD)
- Create new employee records
- Retrieve all employees with pagination and search
- Retrieve a single employee by ID
- Update employee details
- Delete employee records

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication (reused from Task 1)
- Role-based access control — every employee route is **admin-only**
- Protected routes via middleware chain (`protect` → `authorize('admin')`)

### 🛡️ Data Validation & Security
- Required-field validation (name, email, position, department, salary)
- Duplicate email prevention
- Email format validation
- Non-negative salary constraint
- Centralized error handling with meaningful status codes

### ⚙️ Backend Engineering
- RESTful API architecture
- Modular folder structure (controllers, models, routes, middleware)
- Pagination and search on list endpoint
- Audit trail via `createdBy` (tracks which admin created each record)
- MongoDB Atlas integration

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Client (Admin)
  |
  | REST API Requests (with JWT)
  ↓
Express.js Server
  |
  ├── Auth Middleware (protect)
  ├── Role Middleware (authorize: admin)
  ├── Employee Routes
  ├── Employee Controller
  ├── Employee Model
  ↓
MongoDB Atlas Database
```

> Every employee request passes through JWT authentication and role-based authorization before reaching the controller, ensuring only authenticated administrators can perform CRUD operations.

## 📌 API Documentation

> All employee endpoints require a valid JWT belonging to a user with `role: "admin"`. Sign up, log in, then include the returned token as:
> `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`

### 0. Authentication (Signup & Login)

**Endpoint**
```
POST /api/auth/signup
```
```json
{
  "name": "Adarsh",
  "email": "example@gmail.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Endpoint**
```
POST /api/auth/login
```
```json
{
  "email": "example@gmail.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```
Returns a JWT on success. To test admin-only routes below, manually set that user's `role` to `"admin"` in MongoDB Atlas after signing up — full details on the auth system are in [Prodigy_FS_01](https://github.com/aDARSH41Hub/Prodigy_FS_01).

---

### 1. Create Employee

**Endpoint**
```
POST /api/employees
```

**Request Body**
```json
{
  "name": "Priya Sharma",
  "email": "priya.sharma@company.com",

  "department": "Engineering",
  "salary": 65000
}
```

**Response — 201 Created**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Employee created successfully",
  "data": {
    "_id": "64f...",

    "email": "priya.sharma@company.com",
    "position": "Software Engineer",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "salary": 65000,
    "createdBy": "64a...",
    "createdAt": "2026-07-18T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Response — 400 Bad Request** (missing fields or duplicate email)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Employee already exists"
}
```

**Response — 403 Forbidden** (non-admin user)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Access denied: admin only"
}
```

---

### 2. Get All Employees (Pagination + Search)

**Endpoint**
```
GET /api/employees?page=1&limit=10&search=engineering
```

| Query Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `page` | number | Page number (default: 1) |
| `limit` | number | Results per page (default: 10) |
| `search` | string | Matches against `name` or `department` (case-insensitive) |

**Response — 200 OK**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total": 24,
  "page": 1,
  "pages": 3,
  "count": 10,
  "data": [ /* array of employee objects */ ]
}
```

---

### 3. Get Employee by ID

**Endpoint**
```
GET /api/employees/:id
```

**Response — 200 OK**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "_id": "64f...",
    "name": "Priya Sharma",
    "position": "Software Engineer",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "salary": 65000
  }
}
```

**Response — 404 Not Found**

```
DELETE /api/employees/:id
```

**Response — 200 OK**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Employee deleted successfully"
}
```

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aDARSH41Hub/Prodigy_FS_02.git

# Navigate to project
cd Prodigy_FS_02

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create your .env file (see below)

# Run in development (with nodemon)
npm run dev

# Run in production
npm start
```

> ℹ️ To test admin-only routes, sign up a user via `/api/auth/signup`, then manually set that user's `role` field to `"admin"` in MongoDB Atlas — there is intentionally no public endpoint to self-assign admin access.

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your own values:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

> ⚠️ Never commit your actual `.env` file. It's already excluded via `.gitignore`.

---

## 🚀 Quick API Test

1. **Register a user**
   `POST /api/auth/signup`

2. **Log in to obtain a JWT**
   `POST /api/auth/login`

3. **Promote your test user to `admin`** in MongoDB Atlas (edit the `role` field on that user's document directly — there's no public endpoint to self-assign admin).

4. **Include the JWT in every request below**
   `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`

5. **Test the employee CRUD endpoints**
   - `POST /api/employees` — create a record
   - `GET /api/employees` — list, with optional `?page=&limit=&search=`
   - `GET /api/employees/:id` — fetch one
   - `PUT /api/employees/:id` — update
   - `DELETE /api/employees/:id` — remove

6. **Confirm access control** by repeating step 5 with a non-admin token (expect `403`) and with no token at all (expect `401`).

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Verified manually using Postman:

- [x] Create employee as admin → 201, record saved with `createdBy`
- [x] Create employee as non-admin → 403 Access denied
- [x] Create employee with missing required field → 400
- [x] Create employee with duplicate email → 400
- [x] Get all employees → returns paginated list
- [x] Get all employees with `?search=` → filters by name/department
- [x] Get employee by valid ID → 200 with record
- [x] Get employee by non-existent ID → 404
- [x] Update employee → 200, fields updated, validators still enforced
- [x] Delete employee → 200, then GET on same ID → 404
- [x] Access any employee route with no token → 401
- [x] Access any employee route with expired/invalid token → 401

---

## 🔒 Security Highlights

✅ JWT authentication required on every route
✅ Password hashing using bcrypt
✅ Role-based access control (admin-only employee management)
✅ Server-side input validation on all writes
✅ Duplicate-record prevention
✅ Environment variable protection (`.env` excluded from version control)
✅ Audit trail via `createdBy` reference to the creating admin

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Soft delete (archive instead of permanent removal)
- Bulk import/export (CSV)
- Department-level access scoping for non-super-admins
- Activity/audit log for updates and deletions
- API documentation using Swagger
- Frontend admin dashboard
- Unit and integration testing
- Docker deployment
